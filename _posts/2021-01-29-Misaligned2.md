Stardate 98671.69 (1/26/2021)

We spent today alligning the X-Ray beam. 

We went though all of the steps specified by SAXSquant. Everything worked until the sample adjustment stage where we got an error saying "beam intensity is too low". A screencapture of the error is below.

In the meantime, I made a render of the system because it was fun.
